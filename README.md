Project Overview: SQL Data Cleaning for Housing Dataset

In this project, I focused on applying SQL techniques to enhance the readability and usability of a housing dataset. The primary goal was to transform the data to ensure it is fit for further analysis. Throughout this process, I honed my skills in several key areas:

Standardizing Date Columns: Ensuring consistency in date formats for accurate time-based analyses.

Treating Null Values: Implementing strategies to handle missing data effectively.

Splitting Address Column: Decomposing the address field into distinct location columns for better geographical insights.

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and eliminating redundant entries to maintain data integrity.

This project not only improved the dataset but also deepened my understanding of data cleaning methodologies in SQL.
